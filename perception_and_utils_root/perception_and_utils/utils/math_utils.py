     Computes and returns average transformation of frame a to frame b via an intermediate frame (a_T_intermediate & intermediate_T_b).

     NOTE: To compute average of SE3 matrix, we find the average of translation and rotation separately.
             The average rotation is obtained by averaging the quaternions.

             quaternion is always positive for effective averaging.
